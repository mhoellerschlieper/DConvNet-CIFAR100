# DConvNet-CIFAR100
Delphi ConvNet - convolutional neural network for CIFAR100

This is a ConvNet to Delphi 10 (object pascal) translation.

A Convolution Neural Network in Delphi.

This net learns to categorize images to 100 different categories. The pretrained has an acc of 70%. 

Download the CIFAR-100 binaries (Images) from "https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-100-binary.tar.gz" and move them to "Data" directory.

The "Common" directory contains all CNN algorithm sources. The CIFAR_100/work Directory cointais a test project for CIFAR-100. What CIFAR-100 is, you can read at https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
